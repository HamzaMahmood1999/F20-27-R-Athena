How to run Rule Based Knowledge Graph Construction.

Simply start by cloning the git repository. Make sure that your english text file is in the same directory as the RuleBasedKnowledgeGraphConstruction.ipynb file.
You may load the python notebook on your personal computer or google colab and run it without the need for a GPU. This is a rule based approach which means
that it will be executed in short amounts of time, based on the file you provide to it. After that simply run all cells in the python notebook and you will be able
to see the results within the console.
